# Welcome to Rari Capital DAO!

Rari Capital is a suite of decentralized finance protocols on a mission to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical minds, in order to bring the next wave of mass users into this industry.

We have built a series of products that create and deliver aggregate yield, allowing you a simple and safe avenue of value-accrual to your existing assets.

**Fuse:** Open interest rate protocol that provides users the ability to create and manage customizable lending/borrowing pools.

**Yield Aggregator:** An autonomous algorithm that rebalances users' funds into the highest-yield opportunities. Staked funds also provide liquidity to Fuse pools for borrowers.

**Tranches:** Peer-to-peer risk exchange protocol that utilizes the Yield Aggregator DAI pool for customized risk and return profiles.

**Pool 2:** Incentives for RGT liquidity providers on decentralized exchanges.

Enjoy this experience, we are changing the world of finance together as one large community within the Rari Capital Decentralized Autonomous Organization!
