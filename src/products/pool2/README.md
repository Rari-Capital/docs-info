## Decentralized Exchange Liquidity Incentives

The Rari Capital DAO is incentivizing decentralized exchange liquidity of RGT on [Sushiswap](https://sushi.com). Once you stake both RGT and ETH on Sushiswap in the [RGT-ETH Pool](https://app.sushi.com/add/ETH/0xd291e7a03283640fdc51b121ac401383a46cc623), you can stake your SLP tokens on the Pool2 dashboard to earn RGT rewards.
