# Organisational structure

Contributors to Rari are organised in the form of taskforces. Each taskforce is an independent working group, with its own specified objective or vision. Taskforces have a large degree of autonomy in terms of how they spend their resources, how they hire and collaborate with contributors, what decisions they take to achieve their vision and so forth. Taskforces periodically report their progress to the DAO and request resources if needed. For more details, [click here](waiting to publish this article).
